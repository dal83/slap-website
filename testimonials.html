                <p>“Prof. Rad Brosen called me out in class for using ChatGPT on my reading responses, which was a bold-faced lie. The lecture hall had over 50 potential girlfriends, none of whom want to date me now, making me single and lonely. Slap helped me sue Rad for defamation. I squeezed him dry, dropped the class, and my reputation was restored. Thanks, Slap!”</p>

                <p>“My seven-year-old’s friend called me a ‘poopyface’ on Roblox, and I’m a plumber, so this really hurt my reputation. Slap connected me with a small law firm in Boston and got me the justice I deserved.”</p>

                <p>“This crazy ex-TA of mine (who I was technically also dating) hacked into my email and found out I was sleeping with my divinity school professor. He exposed the affair to my deeply devout Christian parents and, even worse, stopped helping me with psets. My life was spiraling out of control, and my grade was slipping toward an A-, but Slap stepped in and connected me with a legal team that specializes in privacy violations and academic disputes. Thanks to Slap, I regained control over my life and can be my true self.”</p>
