        <h2>Case Insurance</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>At Slap, we understand that pursuing justice can be financially risky. To address this, we partner with litigation insurance companies to offer after-the-event (ATE) insurance policies, ensuring our users can focus on their cases without worrying about unexpected costs in the event of a loss.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="benefits">
            <h3>How Does Our Insurance Work?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Slap acts as a managing general agent (MGA), working with litigation insurance providers to offer ATE policies.</li>
                <li>Insurance costs are contingent on case success—clients only pay a portion of the settlement or winnings upon a successful outcome.</li>
                <li>Neither Slap nor its clients are required to pay for insurance upfront, making this a low-risk option for pursuing legal action.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="benefits">
            <h3>What Does the Insurance Cover?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sanctions for filing frivolous lawsuits or unauthorized practice of law.</li>
                <li>Adverse cost rules and other expenses exceeding standard contingency fees.</li>
                <li>Protection against financial risks associated with complex legal cases.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>It’s important to note that our insurance is only valid when cases are accurately described to Slap’s AI evaluator. Incorrect or misleading case details may result in loss of coverage.</p>
            <p>Our insurance offerings are not just a safety net—they’re also a step toward leveling the playing field in the legal system. By providing this protection, Slap empowers individuals and law firms to take on cases with confidence and fairness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Slap’s AI-powered case evaluation and insurance options work hand-in-hand to streamline legal processes while maintaining compliance with evolving AI legal advice regulations.
